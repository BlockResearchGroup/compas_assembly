.. [Frick2016] Data management and modelling of complex interfaces in imperfect discrete-element assemblies.

**Ursula Frick, Tom Van Mele and Philippe Block**

    Recent advances in digital fabrication and on-site construction have created new
    possibilities for the (pre-) fabrication of highly customised building components
    and the realisation of complex, assembled architectural geometries.
    However, currently there are no structural design methods or tools available that
    address the specific challenges related to the design and analysis of discrete assemblies.
    This paper describes an approach for the identification of contact interfaces between
    the  elements of discrete assemblies and presents a data structure for these interactions.
    Furthermore, the paper presents a method for handling misaligned (e.g. intersecting),
    and non-coplanar interfaces.
    The proposed approaches are suitable as computational back-end for equilibrium analysis
    of discrete-element assemblies, such as the Rigid Block Limit Equilibrium method.
