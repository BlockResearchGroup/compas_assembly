:mod:`compas_assembly` contains data structures and algorithms for modelling the individual
elements of Discrete Element Assemblies or Models, and the connections and relationships between them.
The package itself **DOES NOT** provide tools or solvers for computing contact forces between the elements,
nor for analysing the stability of entire assemblies.
To enable such calculations, you have to install additional solver packages such as :mod:`compas_rbe`.
